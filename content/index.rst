Graph Neural Networks and Transformer workshop: Neural Networks for sets
===========

Graph Neural Networks and Transformers are neural network architectures which are quickly gaining in popularity due to how many problems can easily be modeled as graphs and sets. In this workshop we will take a deep dive into these architecture and how you can use them to solve complex problems where the input domain can be of different size.



.. prereq::

   This course assumes familiarity with deep learning, attendendts should have implemented neural networks before using PyTorch. It also assumes basic understanding of linera algebra. Experience in working with graphs will make the material easier to go through, but is not considered a prerequsite.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This course is aimed at students, researchers, engineers and programmers who are already familiar with implementing neural networks in PyTorch and wants to understand the details about graph neural networks and transformers. The focus is on explaining the architectures and the choices involved in implementing a GNN, but does not look into detail of how to model diverse problems using the frameworks. The lessons assumes that the participant is familiar with:

- Programming in PyTorch - having implemented and trained a simple neural network
- Linear algebra - Basic understanding of linear transformations and vector arithmetics
- Machine learning - Basic understanding of training procedures and data issues

- Geometrical Deep Learning: The Erlangen program of ML: This work by Bronstein et. al. takes a unifying perspective on Graph Neural Networks and show how it encapsulates very general ideas in deep learning. This `invited talk <https://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/3717>`_ at ICLR 2021 lays out the ideas which is further expanded on in the pre-print book `Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478>`_.
