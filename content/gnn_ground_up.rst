Graph Neural Networks from the ground up
========================================

In this lesson we go into the details of how to implement a Graph Neural Network. We will be covering the fundamental 
idea of message passing and how to implement this in PyTorch.
We will spend much time working directly with tensors and pytorch.

One technique which we will use often is _broadcasting_ one tensor over another. This `guide <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics>`_ explains the concept.
