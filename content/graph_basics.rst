Graph Basics
============

In this first lesson we will look at basics what graphs are and how we can represent them in plain python. We'll also look at
how to represent the different variables types we typically encounter: continuous and categorical variables. For categorical
variables, well go into details of how to use Embedding layers to create dense vectors and how we can combine multiple categorical
and continuous variables to a single feature vector.
