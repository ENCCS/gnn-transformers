GNNs to Transformers
====================

In the lessons up till now we've familiarized ourselves with how to represent graphs as 
PyTorch tensors, how to implement the graph convolutions and prediction heads. In this 
lesson we'll take another step and show how we can generalize the idea of message passing 
to _learn_ to induce a graph structure from any set data.
